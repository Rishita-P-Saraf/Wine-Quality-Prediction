# Wine-Quality-Prediction
This project utilizes a Decision Tree Classifier to predict wine quality based on various chemical properties. The dataset includes features such as acidity, sugar content, alcohol level, and more.

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains the following attributes:
- `fixed acidity`
- `volatile acidity`
- `citric acid`
- `residual sugar`
- `chlorides`
- `free sulfur dioxide`
- `total sulfur dioxide`
- `density`
- `pH`
- `sulphates`
- `alcohol`
- `quality` (Target variable)

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python
- 📊 Pandas, NumPy
- 🤖 Scikit-Learn
- 📈 Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

---

## 🔍 Project Workflow
1. **Load the dataset**
2. **Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
3. **Preprocess the data** (handling missing values, normalization, etc.)
4. **Train a Decision Tree Classifier**
5. **Evaluate model performance** using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix
6. **Visualize results**

---

## 📊 Results
- ✅ The model achieves an accuracy of **63%** on the test set.
---

## 🔧 Future Improvements
- 🔄 Experiment with other models like **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting**
- 🛠 Hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance
- 🌍 Deploy the model using **Flask** or **FastAPI**
